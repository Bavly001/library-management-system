# React online store
  
## Intro :
  
  Our world is a great place full of countries cities and small villages. You reach all of them by reading their cultures, education, and thoughts. So the website's name is Book the World. As it is a small room you can book it with the book.
  
  
## Project Idea :
  
  This is a Library Management System, which stimulates the system of adding books or removing them according to your authority, or you can just browse the books if you are just a user.
  
  
## How it works ...?
  
  The project depends totally on the front-end only without the back-end so any data stored is stored in (browser local storage) as your registers, login authority, or the books you add or remove.
  The other books viewed on the website are from a fake API [Books List - Django] 
  
  
## Experience fro the project :  
  
  - It makes me go deep in react 
  - Using Hooks for the first time 
  
  
## Challenges :  
  
  The main challenge was to make a full website that simulate the real one only by using browser local storage 
  
  
## Used Library :  
  
  - React JavaScript library
